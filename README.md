# Instagrate

A simple example of using the Document Interaction APIs with Instagram in your iOS app.

Build the project, and run on an iOS 6 (or higher) device. Works best on an actual device, as you need to have Instagram installed (and ideally a camera) to fully experience the prototype

## Why?
Just because. More accurately, just because it wasn't clear to me how this API would work with Instagram from their docs, so I thought I'd build something to find out
